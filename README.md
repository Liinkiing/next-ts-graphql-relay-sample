# Relay TypeScript Next SSG

A sample project where I try various thing in Relay with Next and SSG, with TypeScript
types checking whenever I can.
Also testing relay store as a client store, with some internal directives in
relay like `@__clientField`, very useful to have client-side fields (similar to
[Type Policies](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-field-behavior/) in Apollo)
